# Portfolio 

Hi! This is my personal website / portfolio project that was made using the Next.JS framework. I also used the HeroUI library, Tailwind, TSX, and JSX to help out with a lot of the designs. 

I hope to showcase some of my projects and capabilities here as well as provide a one-stop shop to find all of my inquiry links!

Thank you for taking the time to check this out :)
